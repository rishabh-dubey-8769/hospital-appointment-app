## Overview

This is a fullstack hospital management system with three completely separate React frontends — one for patients, one for doctors, and one for admins — all backed by a single Express.js REST API with role-based access control.

Each role sees a different interface and can only access the endpoints they are authorized for. The backend enforces this at the middleware level using JWT and role verification.

## Role Breakdown

### 🧑‍⚕️ Patient
- Register and login
- Book appointments with available doctors
- View appointment history and status

### 👨‍⚕️ Doctor
- View assigned appointments
- Update appointment status (accept / complete)
- Access patient information for their appointments

### 🔐 Admin
- Manage doctors — add, view, remove
- View and manage all appointments across the system
- Full system oversight

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js |
| Database | MongoDB, Mongoose |
| Auth | JWT (role-based) |
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Deployment | Vercel (frontend) |

---

## Key Implementation Details

- **Three separate frontends** — Admin, Doctor, and Patient each have their own Vite + React app pointing to the same backend, keeping role concerns cleanly separated
- **JWT middleware** — every protected route verifies the token and checks the role before allowing access, preventing cross-role data access
- **MVC structure** — backend organized into `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/` for clear separation of concerns
- **Appointment state machine** — appointments move through defined statuses (pending → accepted → completed) with each role only able to trigger valid transitions

**Backend:**
```bash
cd Backend
npm install
# create .env with MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT
npm run dev
```

**Patient frontend:**
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Doctor frontend:**
```bash
cd Doctor
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Admin frontend:**
